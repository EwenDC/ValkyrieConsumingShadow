Upon seeing you he stops suddenly and begins walking straight towards you. You nervously fumble in your jacket for a weapon to defend yourself, but fail to grab one before the man makes it to within striking distance of you.\n\nThankfully, the man does not attack you. Rather, he seems relieved to see you. "I'm sorry to bother you, but I need help and nobody is answering their door." You ask the man what is wrong and he explains, "I was going to visit my sister and her family, but when I arrived at their house they were not answering the door. I looked through the windows and saw that their lights were on.\n\n"I am worried about my sisters safety. She has gotten herself involved with some unsavoury characters as of late. I think some of them were in her house, as I could hear voices inside that did not belong to her or anyone else in her family. They are meant to be at home tonight, as they had planned to have dinner with me, but there is no sign of them."\n\nYou ask him where the house is and he gives you an address and directions. "She has a husband and a little boy and girl, please make sure they are safe too. If you can just get them out of the house, they can find their way to my place where it is safe." The man thanks you again before hurrying off into the sea of houses. You get in your car and follow the directions given to you.|||

You fear that an evil might have possessed these good people, forcing them to commit unspeakable atrocities against their will. However, when they spot you they beg you to return to your car and leave the district for your own safety.\n\nYou ask them to explain the situation. They tell you fantastical stories of animals bigger than bears, but unlike any creature known to man, attacking local workers in the streets and buildings all over the district. You are skeptical of these stories, until an awful creature suddenly jumps out of a nearby alley and besets the group. With great difficulty they overpower the creature and kill it, but not before losing one of their own in the fight.\n\nThe group again begs you to leave, but you instead ask that they tell you where these creatures are coming from. They try to warn you off going there, but after much insistence tell you about an old warehouse that had been only recently decommissioned. Neighboring buildings reported hearing strange noises coming from within, and chalked it up to an animal infestation. However, everybody who has entered the building since has not made it back out again.\n\nYou thank the group and wish them luck in their endeavours, before heading out in the direction of the old warehouse. As you walk away, you hear members of the group utter quiet prayers for your immortal soul.|||

In the few that are still open, the shopkeepers are uncharacteristically inhospitable. Most refuse to engage in conversation and some even refuse to let you inside. Just as you are ready to give up and investigate elsewhere, a mysterious object in a shop window catches your attention.\n\nWhat would at first glance appear to be a novelty candlestick, you instantly recognise as a vital component in rituals just like the one happening at first light tomorrow morning. You peer inside the shop and notice the shop keeper still in there, attempting to hide her presence. You walk up to the front door and hammer on it repeatedly until your presence can no longer be ignored.\n\nThe woman throws open the door and snarls "We are closed!" She goes to slam the door shut but you grab it and hold it open, demanding to know where she got the component from. After a brief struggle the woman eventually relents and explains,\n\n"I had a lot of people coming into my store and asking for that, so I decided to get it supplied to my store. The first order arrived two weeks ago, and ever since then nothing but misfortune has fallen upon me and my shop. Everybody who has walked out of this shop with one has met an unfortunate end. Another batch arrived three days ago on a boat, but I do not dare go to the docks to collect it."\n\nYou thank the woman and apologise for the intrusion, before heading straight to the dockside. You must retreive the remaining ritual components before they can cause any more damage.|||

You will not live long enough to see the ancient ones return, or to stop it.|||
UIPalace_PriestsWinText.uitext,|||<align="left">Though you fight valiantly, the priests manage to overpower you and kill you where you stand. Their victory, however, is short lived. As they try to leave the scene of the crime they are caught by police and arrested. They are charged with your murder and sentenced to be hanged. The evidence found in your office and on your person is used to convict the remaining cult members, putting a permanent end to their catastrophic rituals and vile schemes.\n\nYour investigation work singlehandedly stopped an invasion of our reality and helped take down three cults, though you did not live to see it happen. Your funeral is a small affair with only one attendee. A police officer, who admired your valiant and unsung work, and wished to spare you from a unremembered passing.\n\nYour death was a red letter day. It marked a decisive victory in the battle between the known and the unknowable. However, though the battle was won, the war was certainly not. Your death marks a significant blow to the effort against the evil cosmic forces lurking in the shadows.\n\nThough you can no longer fight to defend our reality, your actions will inspire a whole new generation of investigators. Ready to explore topics others dismiss. Ready to go places others do not dare. Ready to fight that which would paralyse most men with fear.|||

EventPalace_PlaceAtticBallroom.text,The small attic space of the palace is dusty and full of old furniture. Though the palace proper is well maintained, it is clearly rare for anyone to venture into this wing, making it an ideal spot to hide from prying eyes. Place the {c:TilePalace_Attic} tile as indicated. Then discard the Explore token that connects the {c:TilePalace_Ballroom} and the {c:TilePalace_Attic}.
