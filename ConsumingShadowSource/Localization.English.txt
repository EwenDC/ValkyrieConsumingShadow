EventViewEvidence_MissingLink_YigHateZhar.text,|||The professor's notes record what she discovered while researching ancient Briton religion. She noted two prominent religions that existed between the 1st and 10th centuries AD, far longer than any other within their culture. One of the religions worshipped a god called "Zhar," while the other a god called "Yig." The history between these two religions is long and sordid, with many recounts of bloody battles fought between the respective worshippers. An old Briton fable even revolves around the animosity, with a man who converts from one of the religions to the other, and then murders his family when they do not do the same.|||

You will be constantly on edge, waiting for the return of the ancient being whose evil plans you know you only temporarily foiled.\n\nOn your deathbed you will be a broken mess, young and alone, with no trust in anyone but yourself. You will not live long enough to see the ancient ones return, or to stop it.|||
UIPalace_EliminatedText.uitext,|||<align="left">The loss of your fellow investigator leaves the group in shambles. You struggle to continue the investigation, but the loss of your ally proves devastating. Though you try your hardest to continue on, you simply lack the manpower to make enough headway on stopping the ritual.\n\nBefore you know it, the sun crests the horizon and the town is bathed in the orange light of dawn. Though the dawns vibrant light pours through the palace windows, the inside of the palace is darker than ever before. You desperately fling open doors, trying your hardest to find the summoning ritual, but only succeeding in becoming hopelessly lost.\n\nHad the ritual even been here in the first place? Your broken mind cannot figure it out. You begin to question the nature of your reality, as your last remaining shred of sanity slips away. Suddenly, a loud crash deafens your ears as the roof of the palace is torn off by a being beyond human comprehension.\n\nYou are too late. Within minutes, everything you know will be replaced with a reality of infinite horror and torture. You spare a moment to mourn the loss of our world, before cowardly putting your gun to your head and pulling the trigger.|||
UIPalace_FailedBanishText.uitext,|||<align="left">If history books were still to be written, they would speak gravely of your attempt at creating a counter-ritual. Historians would describe you as being in over your head, fantastically underqualified for the tasks you had elected to take on. Your failed investigation would be derided and nit-picked endlessly by those blessed with the clear vision of hindsight.\n\nFortunately, none of those things would be written about you, or indeed anything else. As the ancient one and its minions poured into our world, few survived more than a couple of minutes. Those that did were relentlessly tortured until they wished they had not.\n\nWhat became of our world after that is too incomprehensibly horrific to describe. Suffice it to say, you should be thankful death came for you first.\n\n|||
UIPalace_GodWinText.uitext,|||<align="left">If history books were still to be written, they would speak highly of your valiant attempt to fight off the ancient one single-handedly. Historians would not fault you for succumbing to your injuries or insanity, as the fight itself was a forgone conclusion. You would be praised for managing to last as long as you did, and hailed as a shining beacon of humanity.\n\nSadly, none of those things would be written about you, or indeed anything else.

UIPalace_IntroText.uitext,|||<align="left">You drive your car up the long and winding road leading to Governors Palace. While there are several cars parked outside, the building itself is eerily quiet. A thought flashes in your head, what if the translation was wrong? What if there is no invasion happening? You disregard the idea. Even if that were true, you cannot risk what will happen if the translations are correct.\n\nYou pause to consider all of the evidence you have collected so far. You are unsure if it will be enough, but then again, no amount of evidence could sufficiently prepare you for something like this. You steel yourself, before approaching the palaces grand entrance.|||
UIPalace_PriestsWinText.uitext,|||<align="left">Though you fight valiantly, the priests manage to overpower you and kill you where you stand. Their victory, however, is short lived. As they try to leave the scene of the crime they are caught by police and arrested. They are charged with your murder and sentenced to be hanged. The evidence found in your office and on your person is used to convict the remaining cult members, putting a permanent end to their catastrophic rituals and vile schemes.\n\nYour investigation work single-handedly stopped an invasion of our reality and helped take down three cults, though you did not live to see it happen. Your funeral is a small affair with only one attendee. A police officer, who admired your valiant and unsung work, and wished to spare you from a unremembered passing.\n\nYour death was a red letter day. It marked a decisive victory in the battle between the known and the unknowable. However, though the battle was won, the war was certainly not. Your death marks a significant blow to the effort against the evil cosmic forces lurking in the shadows.\n\nThough you can no longer fight to defend our reality, your actions will inspire a whole new generation of investigators. Ready to explore topics others dismiss. Ready to go places others do not dare. Ready to fight that which would paralyse most men with fear.|||

UIPrologue_Text.uitext,|||<align="left">You throw down the telegram you are reading and curse loudly. How could you have not seen this sooner? You cross-reference the translated runes, but only find evidence that corroborates the story. The telegram must be telling the truth. At the first light of tomorrow morning, a ritual will be performed at the site of the Old Governors Palace. A ritual to summon an Ancient One into our world.\n\nYou stand up and pace around your office. You have spent the last few months occupied with your investigation into three local cults, but you would have never imagined any of them capable of more than hosting tea parties. Clearly, you were mistaken.\n\nWhile the message you have received is a barely coherent ramble, you cannot risk ignoring it. It speaks of one of the cults you have been following as the perpetrator of the vile ritual, with another one lending it aid. The third cult is said to be working against the other two, but you find that fact to be of little solace.\n\nYou slide back into your chair and review the telegram. You desperately search for any clues identifying the cults being discussed, but find nothing. The translated runes on your desk contain exact instructions on how to perform a banishment ritual capable of stopping an Ancient One's invasion. However, the ritual described requires information about the Ancient One being banished to be performed.\n\nYou curse again. You are short on leads and even shorter on time. You throw your jacket on, grab your gun, and head out into town.|||

UIWarehouse_IntroText.uitext,|||<align="left">You do not make it far into the lines of industrial buildings before encountering some locals wandering the street, brandishing weapons covered in dark sticky blood. You fear that an evil might have possessed these good people, forcing them to commit unspeakable atrocities against their will. However, when they spot you, they beg you to return to your car and leave the district for your own safety.\n\nYou ask them to explain the situation. They tell you fantastical stories of animals bigger than bears, but unlike any creature known to man, attacking local workers in the streets and buildings all over the district. You are sceptical of these stories, until an awful creature suddenly jumps out of a nearby alley and besets the group. With great difficulty they overpower the creature and kill it, but not before losing one of their own in the fight.\n\nThe group again begs you to leave, but you instead ask that they tell you where these creatures are coming from. They try to warn you off going there, but after much insistence tell you about an old warehouse that had been only recently decommissioned. Neighbouring buildings reported hearing strange noises coming from within but chalked it up to an animal infestation. However, everybody who has entered the building since has not made it back out again.\n\nYou thank the group and walk away, some of them uttering quiet prayers for your immortal soul as you leave. You head in the direction of the old warehouse, intent on destroying the infestation before it can claim anymore innocent lives.|||
