You arrive at the Residential District, leaving your car behind to investigate the endless rows of houses. You wander down the empty streets for a while but see nothing untoward. A silence blankets the night as you pass house after house of sleeping residents, occasionally interrupted by a dim light coming from a bedroom or study.

You are preparing to return to your car when you spot a man aimlessly wandering the empty streets. Upon seeing you he suddenly stops and begins walking straight towards you. You nervously fumble in your jacket for a weapon to defend yourself, but fail to grab one before the man makes it to within striking distance of you.

Thankfully, the man does not attack you. Rather, he seems relieved to see you. "I'm sorry to bother you, but do you know where I could find a lodging to stay the night?" You ask the man about his situation and he explains it to you. "I was meant to stay the night with my sister and her family, but when I arrived at their house they refused to answer the door. I know that they are home, because all of their lights are on.

"I do worry about my sister. She has gotten herself involved with some unusual characters as of late. And I swear I heard chanting coming from their house too, although maybe that was just the night air getting to me." You direct the man to the nearest inn and offer to investigate his sisters house. He accepts your offer and gives you her address, before thanking you and walking away.
