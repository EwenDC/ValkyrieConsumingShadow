The sun sets on another ordinary day in the town of Arkham. While most of the residents are getting ready to rest for the night, you are pacing nervously around your office, unable to sleep. As an investigator for the Department of Paranormal Activity, you're familiar with the extended periods of inactivity that come part and parcel with the job. This time however, you can't shake the feeling that something is terribly wrong.

It's been months since your boss B has contacted you to perform a job. Usually there's always the odd mess that needs cleaning: A library unknowingly stocking ancient texts of dark power; Some bored teenagers attempting to perform dangerous rituals on a dare; A jealous ex-lover lured into fooling with magic beyond their comprehension. But for the last three months there hasn't been a single incident in the entire town.

Your nightmares are getting worse. You've taken to substituting sleep with a fresh bottle of Gin. As you prepare to crack open another one, the telephone rings.

"Hey, it's B. I know it's been a while since we've talked but I have an urgent matter that needs resolving." He pauses for a moment, lost in thought. "You've felt it too, haven't you? Like something wasn't right these last few months. I think I may now know why. There's no easy way to say this, but an ancient being is going to try and enter our reality at sunrise tommorow."

You sit in stunned silence. After a few moments a million questions try to exit your mouth at once. B cuts you off. "Slow down, I'll tell you everything I know. While we've been sitting on our hands these last few months a cult has been operating in the shadows of Arkham, slowly building their strengh. Well, actually, not just one... There are three of them."

Three? Three cults? The entire time you spent devoting your complete attention to guarding Arkham, three cults were somehow able to fester and grow in the shadows. You curse your inattentiveness and vow to never let something like this happen again.

"How do we stop it?"

"The question is not of 'how' but of 'who'. There is a longstanding feud between three so-called 'gods.' One of the god's wishes to take control of our reality, and is being aided by the second god. The third god hates the first two and wishes to stop the first one from completing their goal. Each of these gods has one cult worshipping them and doing their bidding in some foolish attempt to gain their favour.

"I know where the ritual will take place, and I know the counter-ritual required to banish an ancient diety from this plane forever. However, if we don't stop the ritual in time, or we banish the wrong god, this could spell the end of our reality as we know it. I need you to investigate the cults and find the invading god."

You find yourself unable to comprehend the current situation. You express your uncertainty on where to begin your investigation. "A few disturbances have started cropping up within Arkham. Maybe you should start your investigation there?"
--
"What disturbances?"
--
"There are reports of a supposed animal infestation in an abandoned warehouse in the Industrial District. Everybody who has entered the building to investigate, however, has gone missing.

"A visitor from out of town has reported that family they were meant to stay with in Arkham uncharacteristically refused to answer their door. As the visitor walked away from the property, they witnessed robed figures being granted entry inside the house.

"I've also been hearing rumors of strange events taking place in the docklands of the Commercial District."

You are aware that you have limited time, and any problems left alone will become gradually worse. Considering your options, you decide to first go to:

The Warehouse

The House

The Docks
