You open the creeky door to your office and deposit your jacket on the coat rack. Your day has been filled with nothing but dead ends and false positives. You wish for nothing more than to slip under your bedsheets and drift off into a deep slumber, but a fresh telegram sitting on your desk stops you.

You sit in your chair and start reading the message. "Translated those runes for you as requested. You are really going to want to read this." Your eyes scan through the translations and your brow furrows as you process their meaning.

You throw down the telegram and curse loudly. How could you have not seen this sooner? You check your notes again but the conclusion you draw does not change. At the first light of tommorrow morning, a ritual will be performed at the site of the Old Governors Palace. A ritual to summon an Ancient One into our world.

You stand up from your desk and pace around your office. You have spent the last few months occupied with your investigation into three local cults, but you would have never imagined any of them capable of more than just hosting tea parties together.

You slide back into your chair and review the telegram. The runes contain exact instructions on how to stop the ritual, but stop short of saying what ancient being is trying to invade our realm. Without that knowledge, you are unable to perform the counter-ritual.

You curse again. You are short on leads and even shorter on time. You throw your jacket on, grab your gun, and head out into town.
